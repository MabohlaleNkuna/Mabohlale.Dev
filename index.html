         I am a Full-Stack Developer passionate about building impactful, scalable solutions. While I’ve recently joined the PLP Academy to further sharpen my skills, I’ve previously gained experience through platforms like Zaio Coding School and Botlhale AI. I have a solid foundation in technologies such as React, Node.js, Firebase, MongoDB, Java, and Python, and I’m always eager to keep learning and growing in the tech space.
